    "# Introduction\n",
    "For my main contribution to our project, I made a camera using javascript that takes three pictures and stores it on our page. It works with backend code to generate the user's emotion label. One of my group members had to take my camera and tweak it to have it work with our backend. Although my final version of the camera isn't on the site, it was used in our drafting process.\n",

    "# Process of the Camera \n",

    "- but it looked very bad, it had bad styling and a black border that wasn't nessary"

The correct answer is D because the for loop control variable k starts with the value 3, is incremented by 1 and terminates the loop when its value is arr.length – 1. In the first iteration, when k is 3, arr[3] is assigned the value arr[4]. The contents of the arr have been updated to {1, 2, 3, 5, 5, 6, 7}. In the second iteration, when k is 4, arr[4] is assigned the value arr[5]. The contents of arr have been updated to {1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 6, 7}. In the third iteration, when k is 5, arr[5] is assigned the value arr[6]. The contents of arr have been updated to {1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 7}. Then k is incremented to 6 and the loop terminates.\n",

D is wrong because at //Point C, n will be 2 or less, since when n is greater than 2, the while loop iterates decrementing n until it has the value 2.

At this point, n will always be greater than 2.\n",

C is correct because passing a reference parameter results in the formal parameter and the actual parameter being aliases. \n",

The variable x is assigned 1 to start and then incremented by 2. It will be assigned the values 1, 3, 5 and then 7. When x has the value 7, the loop will terminate. The output will be 1 3 5. Choice II will cause the while loop to iterate as long as x is not equal to 6. The variable x is assigned 1 to start and then incremented by 2. It will be assigned 1, 3, 5, 7, ... and will cause an infinite loop as it will never equal 6. Choice III will cause the while loop to iterate while x is less than 7. D is correct because \n"
