    "Situation: The school librarian wants to create a program that stores all of the books within the library in a database and is used to manage their inventory of books available to the students. You decided to put your amazing code skills to work and help out the librarian!\n",
    "\n",
    "a. Describe the key differences between the private and public access controllers and how it affects a POJO\n",
    "**Private access modifiers in POJOs restrict access to fields or methods within the same class, ensuring data hiding and preventing external interference, as they can only be accessed within the class they are declared in. On the other hand, public access modifiers make fields or methods accessible from any other class, which can lead to a loss of control over data integrity and increases the risk of unintended modifications, as they can be freely accessed and modified by any part of the program.**\n",
    "\n",
    "b. Identify a scenario when you would use the private vs. public access controllers that isn't the one given in the scenario above\n",
    "**In a banking application, private access controllers would secure sensitive data like account balances, while public access controllers would enable methods like deposit and withdraw to be accessible for account interactions.**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "c. Create a Book class that represents the following attributes about a book: title, author, date published, person holding the book and make sure that the objects are using a POJO, the proper getters and setters and are secure from any other modifications that the program makes later to the objects\n",

The subclass inherits all the fields and methods of the superclass and can also have its own additional fields and methods. This allows for code reuse, abstraction, and the creation of a hierarchical structure among classes. An example scenario where inheritance is useful is in modeling different types of vehicles. You can have a superclass called Vehicle with common attributes and methods shared by all vehicles, such as speed, color, and a method to start the vehicle. Then, you can have subclasses like Car, Bicycle, and Truck, each with specific attributes and methods unique to that type of vehicle. This way, you avoid redundancy by defining common functionalities once in the superclass and specialize them as needed in subclasses.**\n",
