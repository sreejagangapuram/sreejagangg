    "## Part A\n",
    "I wanted to create a method to quickly add up all the numbers in an array. This meant I needed to understand basic loops and variables in Java.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make the method, I wrote a simple loop that went through each number in the array. Inside the loop, I used a variable to keep track of the total sum. At the start of the loop, I set this variable to zero. Then, with each loop, I added the current number to the total.\n",
    "\n",
    "Testing the method was easy. I made a small array with a few numbers and used my method to find their total. I checked if the total matched what I expected by adding the numbers manually.\n",
    "\n",
    "Developing this method helped me practice simple programming techniques and understand how to quickly solve basic tasks in Java.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part B\n",
    "I initialized an array to store the row sums, then used a loop to go through each row of the 2D array. Inside the loop, I calculated the sum of the current row using the arraySum method, which I'd already made for summing 1D arrays. I stored each row sum in the corresponding index of the result array.\n",
    "\n",
    "Testing the method was simple. I made a sample 2D array, ran the rowSums method on it, and checked if the output matched what I expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part C \n",
    "I started by initializing an array to hold the row sums, with its length matching the number of rows in the input 2D array. Then, using a loop, I went through each row of the 2D array. Inside the loop, I used the arraySum method I had previously created to find the sum of the current row, and stored this sum in the corresponding index of the result array.\n",
    "\n",
    "Testing the method was straightforward. I created a sample 2D array called mat1, filled it with values, and called the rowSums method on it. Using Arrays.toString, I printed the resulting array to verify that the row sums were computed correctly."
