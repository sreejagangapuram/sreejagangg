    "After a guess is made, the player is given a hint that is based on a comparison between the hidden word and the guess.

    "# FRQ 2 REFLECTION\n",
    "The frq tells us to create a Java class that has a hidden word puzzle, where the goal is to guess the hidden word based on hints provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step was to design the class structure. I identified the need for a class named HiddenWord to represent the puzzle. This class would have a private field to store the hidden word and a method to generate hints based on the guessed word. Understanding the use of constructors for initializing objects was fundamental in setting up the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implementing the getHint method was the core of the challenge. I needed to devise a strategy to compare the guessed word with the hidden word and generate appropriate hints. This involved iterating through each character of the guessed word and applying logical conditions to determine whether the characters matched, existed in the hidden word but in a different position, or were absent altogether.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the implementation phase, I encountered various coding concepts such as string manipulation, character comparison, and conditional statements. I realized the importance of using efficient data structures like StringBuilder to concatenate strings within loops to enhance performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Testing the code was another critical aspect of the development process. I wrote test cases in the main method to validate the functionality of the getHint method for different scenarios. This helped me ensure that the code produced the correct hints according to the rules of the hidden word puzzle.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, developing the HiddenWord class led me to develop problem-solving and testing strategies. It was a good practice of java skills. "
