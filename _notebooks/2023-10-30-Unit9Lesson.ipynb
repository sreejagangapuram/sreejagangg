    "## 9.3 Overriding Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Method overriding is a concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass. This enables a subclass to provide its own behavior for a method while maintaining a relationship with its superclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context Java, here's how method overriding works:\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance: Method overriding is closely related to inheritance. You have a superclass (or base class) and a subclass (or derived class). The subclass inherits properties and behaviors from the superclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "Superclass Method: The superclass defines a method. This method can be overridden by the subclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "Subclass Overrides: In the subclass, you can provide a new implementation of the same method. This is done by using the same method name, return type, and parameter list.\n",
    "\n",
    "@Override Annotation (Java): In Java, it's common to use the @Override annotation to explicitly indicate that a method in the subclass is intended to override a method in the superclass. This helps catch errors during compilation if the method doesn't correctly match the superclass method signature.\n",
    "\n",
    "<script>message any of us on slack \"Love\" for an extra 0.01 (max of 1/1)</script>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Override Methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "Method overriding is used for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "Customization: It allows you to customize or extend the behavior of a superclass method in the subclass to meet the specific needs of the subclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism: Method overriding is a key component of polymorphism. It enables you to treat objects of the subclass as if they were objects of the superclass, promoting flexibility and extensibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consistency: Method overriding helps maintain a consistent interface for classes in an inheritance hierarchy. Code that uses the superclass doesn't need to be changed when a subclass overrides a method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Code Reusability: It promotes code reusability by allowing you to build on existing code in the superclass."

Nevertheless, various athlete types might require distinct training methods, dietary plans, and more, which can be customized using the 'override' feature. This approach eliminates the need to recreate an 'Athlete' class for each athlete and instead allows the modification of specific methods within the base class.

    "### Complex Java Inheritance FRQ: Vehicle Types\n",
    "\n",
    "You are tasked with developing a Java program to model a vehicle management system for a transportation company that deals with various types of vehicles. The company manages four different types of vehicles: Cars, Motorcycles, Trucks, and Bicycles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each vehicle type has specific attributes and methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Cars:\n",
    "  - Attributes: Model (String), Year (int), FuelType (String)\n",
    "  - Method: startEngine() (prints \"Car engine started\")\n",
    "\n",
    "- Motorcycles:\n",
    "  - Attributes: Model (String), Year (int), EngineType (String)\n",
    "  - Method: startEngine() (prints \"Motorcycle engine started\")\n",
    "\n",
    "- Trucks:\n",
    "  - Attributes: Model (String), Year (int), CargoCapacity (double)\n",
    "  - Method: startEngine() (prints \"Truck engine started\")\n",
    "\n",
    "- Bicycles:\n",
    "  - Attributes: Model (String), Year (int), FrameMaterial (String)\n",
    "  - Method: pedal() (prints \"Bicycle pedaling\")\n",
    "\n",
    "FRQ Task:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Design a Java program that effectively models the inheritance hierarchy for the vehicle types as described above. Implement the necessary classes, constructors, and methods.\n",
    "2. Create an application to showcase the use of these classes. Generate instances of each vehicle type and invoke their respective methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scoring Guidelines:\n",
    "- Proper implementation of classes, constructors, and methods: 2 points\n",
    "- Correct usage of inheritance and method overriding: 2 points\n",
    "- Successful demonstration of polymorphism and expected output: 2 points\n",
